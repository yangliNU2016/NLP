3.1 How many times does the past tense verb said occur in the Brown corpus?
\b[Ss]aid\b 1961

3.2 When said occurs with a full sentence, it often uses the complementizer that. How often does said occur with 
that immediately following? If we assume that all of these cases are actually the complementizer that 
(and not, e.g., the pronoun that as in ¡®I never said that.¡¯), what proportion of the time is said used with the 
complementizer that?
\bsaid that\b 106
\bsaid that \b 100
If used as a complementizer not pronoun, "that" should be followed by a space.
we may suggest only 6 cases out 106 cases where "that" is used as a pronoun where there is a either '.' or ',' or
something else followed, and 100 cases out 106 cases where "that" is used as a complementizer.

3.3 Another common usage of said is with an embedded-question. We can get a rough estimate of the number of times 
said is used with embedded questions by explicitly searching for said occurring immediately prior to a question 
word (what, who, when, where, how, why, which). How many times is said used with each type of embedded question? 
What proportion of the time is it used with any of these types of embedded question?
\b[Ww]hat said|[Ww]hat [a-z]+ said|[Ww]hat [a-z]+ [a-z]+ said\b 26 cases out of 70 cases
\b[Ww]ho said|[Ww]ho [a-z]+ said|[Ww]ho [a-z]+ [a-z]+ said\b 14 cases out of 70 cases
\b[Ww]hen said|[Ww]hen [a-z]+ said|[Ww]hen [a-z]+ [a-z]+ said\b 16 cases out of 70 cases
\b[Ww]here said|[Ww]here [a-z]+ said|[Ww]here [a-z]+ [a-z]+ said\b 3 cases out of 70 cases
\b[Hh]ow said|[Hh]ow [a-z]+ said|[Hh]ow [a-z]+ [a-z]+ said\b 1 case out of 70 cases
\b[Ww]hy said|[Ww]hy [a-z]+ said|[Ww]hy [a-z]+ [a-z]+ said\b 0 out of 70 cases
\b[Ww]hich said|[Ww]hich [a-z]+ said|[Ww]hich [a-z]+ [a-z]+ said\b 10 cases out of 70 cases
26 + 14 + 16 + 3 + 1 + 0 + 10 = 70
